## About Me
Hello! I'm Muhammad Asyrafi Hidayatullah, a dedicated computer science student with a great passion for technology and software development. Currently pursuing my studies while exploring the vast world of programming—from web development to software engineering and beyond.

I want to be honest: I'm not yet great at writing code entirely on my own. I often use AI as a tool to help me understand, learn, and find solutions. For me, that's not a weakness—it's part of the learning process. I've had a laptop since middle school, but I didn't dive deep into programming back then. Now, with my understanding continuously growing, I keep finding my own path to become better day by day.

I'm on a journey of discovery, learning various technologies and paradigms as I pursue my dream of becoming a computer scientist capable of creating meaningful and impactful solutions.

## Current Journey
- **Full Stack Development:** Building complete web applications from front-end to back-end
- **Software Engineering:** Exploring desktop applications and system-level programming
- **UI/UX Design:** Crafting intuitive and user-centered digital experiences
- **Continuous Learning:** Embracing new technologies and discovering where my true passion lies

## Technical Arsenal
- **Web Technologies:** Modern frameworks and libraries for full stack development
- **Multiple Programming Paradigms:** Object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming
- **Database Systems:** Relational database design and management
- **Development Tools:** Version control, containerization, and modern IDEs
- **Design Tools:** Professional UI/UX design platforms

## Hobbies
- Reading technical books and documentation
- Exploring emerging technologies
- Designing user interfaces
- Solving complex problems through code

## My Vision
My dream is to become a highly skilled computer scientist—someone who can build anything from elegant web platforms to powerful software applications. I may still be finding my exact path, but I'm driven by immense curiosity and commitment to master the art of creating technology that matters.
